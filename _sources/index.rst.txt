Installation
============

You can install Compyute directly from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/dakofler/Compyute.git


As of ``CuPy`` v13, the package does not require a GPU toolkit to be installed, so ``Compyute`` can be used on CPU-only machines. If you want to make use of GPUs, make sure to install the CUDA Toolkit following the `installation guide <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html>`_ of ``CuPy``.

Usage
=====

There are example-notebooks included that show how to use the toolbox and its ``Tensor`` object. Similar to ``PyTorch``, in ``Compyute`` a ``Tensor``-object represents the central block that keeps track of data and gradients. However, unlike ``PyTorch``, ``Compyute`` does not support autograd to compute gradients (yet?). Instead the computation of gradients is defined within a model's layers and functions.

Tensors
-------

``Tensors`` can be created from nested lists of values. Additionally, a ``device`` where the tensor should be stored on, and a ``dtype`` of the tensor data can be specified. ``Compyute`` provides several methods to change these settings.

.. code-block:: python

    import compyute as cp

    # create a tensor from a list of lists, the data type is inferred automatically
    x = cp.tensor([[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

    # alternatively, define data types
    x = cp.tensor([1, 2, 3], dtype=cp.int32)

    # change datatypes
    y = x.to_type(cp.float32)
    y = x.to_float()
    y = x.to_int()

    # define the device the tensor is stored on
    c = cp.tensor([1, 2, 3], device=cp.cuda)

    # change devices
    c = c.to_device(cp.cpu)
    c = c.to_cpu()


The ``Tensor`` object supports most operations also known from ``PyTorch`` tensors or ``NumPy`` arrays. Here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

    # basic arithmetic
    z = x + y
    z = x - y
    z = x * y
    z = x / y
    x += 10

    # operations from linear algebra
    z = x @ y
    z = cp.inner(x, y)
    z = cp.outer(x, y)

    # aggregate elements of a tensor
    z = cp.sum(x, axis=0)
    z = cp.mean(x, axis=0)

    # functions for initializing tensors
    z = cp.ones(shape=(10, 10))
    z = cp.zeros(shape=(10, 10))
    z = cp.full(shape=(10, 10), value=99)
    z = cp.random.normal(shape=(10, 10))

Building models
---------------
Models can be built using predefined modules (such as ``Linear`` or ``ReLU``) and containers (such as ``Sequential``). ``Compyute`` provides a variety of modules such as activation, normalization, linear, convolutional and recurrent layers with more to come. For a list of available modules, see :ref:`modules`.

.. code-block:: python

    from compyute import nn

    model = nn.Sequential(
        nn.Linear(4, 16),
        nn.ReLU(),
        nn.Linear(16, 3),
    )

    model.to_device(cp.cuda)  # move model to GPU


Alternatively, models can also be built entirely from scratch by defining custom classes that inherit from the ``Module`` base class.

With custom models, the user defines what modules to use and how data and gradients flow through the network. Models are generally composed of one or more ``Modules``.

When inheriting from predefined containers, such as ``Sequential``, the forward-function is already defined.

.. code-block:: python

    from compyute import nn

    class MyConvBlock(nn.Sequential):
        def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):

            conv = nn.Conv2D(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3)
            relu = nn.ReLU()
            bn = nn.BatchNorm2D(out_channels)
            
            # pass modules to the `Sequential` base class
            super().__init__(conv, relu, bn)


If you want to define a custom forward-method, the ``Module`` base class can be used.

.. code-block:: python

    from compyute import nn

    class MyModel(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

            self.lin1 = nn.Linear(4, 16)
            self.relu = nn.ReLU()
            self.lin2 = nn.Linear(16, 3)

            # define the forward pass
            @nn.Module.register_forward
            def forward(self, x):
                x = self.lin1(x)
                x = self.relu(x)
                x = self.lin2(x)
                return x

            # define the backward pass
            @nn.Module.register_backward
            def backward(self, dy):
                dy = self.lin2.backward(dy)
                dy = self.relu.backward(dy)
                dy = self.lin1.backward(dy)
                return dy        


Training models
---------------

All modules can be trained and updated using common optimizer algorithms, such as ``SGD`` or ``Adam``. Callbacks offer extended functionality such as tracking the loss-values during training. An easy and approchable way is to use a ``Trainer`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    from compyute.nn.trainer import Trainer
    from compyute.nn.trainer.callbacks import EarlyStopping, History, Progressbar

    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        optimizer="sgd",
        loss_function="cross_entropy",
        metric_function="accuracy",
        callbacks=[EarlyStopping(), History(), Progressbar()]
    )

    trainer.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)


Alternatively, you can write your own training loop.

.. code-block:: python

    epochs = 100
    batch_size = 32

    train_dl = nn.utils.Dataloader((X_train, y_train), batch_size)
    val_dl = nn.utils.Dataloader((X_val, y_val), batch_size, shuffle=False)

    loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optim = nn.optimizers.SGD(model.get_parameters())

    for epoch in range(epochs):

        # training
        model.training()
        for x, y in train_dl():

            # forward pass
            y_pred = model(x)
            _ = loss_fn(y_pred, y)

            # backward pass
            optim.reset_grads()  # reset all gradients
            model.backward(loss_fn.backward())  # compute new gradients
            optim.step()  # update parameters
        
        # validiation
        model.inference()
        with nn.no_caching():  # disable caching required for gradient computation
            val_loss = 0
            for x, y in val_dl():
                y_pred = model(x)
                val_loss += loss_fn(y_pred, y).item()
            val_loss /= len(val_dl)

        print(f"epoch {epoch}: {val_loss=:.4f}")


Model checkpoints can also be saved and loaded later on.

.. code-block:: python
    
    # save the model state
    state = {
        "model": model.get_state_dict(),
        "optimizer": optim.get_state_dict(),
    }
    cp.save(state, "my_model.cp")

    # load the states
    model = MyModel()
    optim = nn.optimizers.SGD(model.get_parameters())
    loaded_state = cp.load("my_model.cp")
    model.load_state_dict(loaded_state["model"])
    optim.load_state_dict(loaded_state["optimizer"])

Final notes
===========

I use this project to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of neural networks. Therefore, project is a work in progress and possibly will forever be, as I am planning to constantly add new features and optimizations. The code is by far not perfect, as I am still learning with every new feature that is added. If you have any suggestions or find any bugs, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Cheers,
Daniel
